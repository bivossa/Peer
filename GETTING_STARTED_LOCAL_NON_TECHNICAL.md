# Getting Started Locally: A Simple Guide

This document explains what we did to make this project work on a local computer, written in simple terms for non-technical people.

---

## What We Were Trying to Do
We wanted to run the PeerReplit application on a local computer so it could be viewed in a web browser at http://localhost:5000.

---

## The Problems We Found and How We Fixed Them

### Problem 1: Missing Building Blocks
**What happened:** When we tried to start the application, the computer said it couldn't find some essential tools it needed to run.

**Why this happened:** The project was missing its required building blocks (called "dependencies") that need to be downloaded and installed first.

**How we fixed it:** We ran a command to download and install all the necessary building blocks that the project needs to function.

---

### Problem 2: Confused File Locations
**What happened:** The application couldn't figure out where to find important files on the computer.

**Why this happened:** The code was using a modern way to locate files that doesn't work reliably on all computer setups.

**How we fixed it:** We updated the code to use a more reliable method for finding files that works consistently across different computer systems.

---

### Problem 3: Type Mismatch in Settings
**What happened:** The application's configuration had a small error in how it was telling the system what type of security settings to use.

**Why this happened:** The configuration was using a general setting when it needed a specific one.

**How we fixed it:** We changed the setting to be more specific about what type of security configuration it wanted.

---

### Problem 4: Port Already in Use
**What happened:** The computer said the door (port) that the application wanted to use was already being used by another program.

**Why this happened:** A previous version of the application was still running in the background.

**How we fixed it:** We stopped the old version of the application and started a fresh one.

## The Result
After fixing these issues, the application now runs successfully and can be accessed through a web browser. The system shows that it's working by displaying messages about various parts of the application loading successfully.

## Key Lessons for Future Projects
- Always install the required building blocks before trying to run a project
- Modern file location methods might not work on all systems - use reliable alternatives
- Pay attention to the specific types of settings that configuration files expect
- If you get a "port in use" error, make sure to stop any previous versions of the application

## For Technical Teams
This document serves as a simple explanation of the debugging process. The technical details and code changes are documented in the companion file `GETTING_STARTED_LOCAL.md`.
